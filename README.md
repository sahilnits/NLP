# Sentiment Analysis and Topic modelling on Amazon reviews - Project Proposal.

## Team: Mayank Varshney, Sahil Dhingra and Prasad Yacham

### Project Summary 

__This data driven web application will use the Amazon Reviews for various categories, perform sentiment analysis and topic modelling for those categories and provide positive/negative feedback (Sentiment Analysis) based on the different topics for each of the categories. This would help the Amazon sellers/vendors and customers to know what the general sentiment about a particular product is and at the same time make an informed decision. For seller, decision can be to fix issues or do more marketing and for customers, decision can be to buy or not to buy a product.__ 

### Project Description 

__Main aim for this project is to derive insightful analytics from textual data using NLP and help the application user to make an informed decision. Particularly, this web application will be helpful for E-commerce, Web based products (like shoplifty, Amazon, Netflix, sellers/vendors) to enhance the product based on customer feedback and provide insights to other teams like marketing and advertisement and engineering based on product performance. On the other hand, it will help consumer to make more informed decision based on review analytics and customized product advertisement.__

### Objectives:

__Through this project, we will achieve the below mentioned primary objectives: 
•	For each of the categories, provide positive/negative reviews for the key features for various products in the categories. For example, in the cell phone category, we can have reviews for different topics – sound, camera, storage etc. This would provide details to the vendors/sellers about the good things that they have provided in the products and allow them to improve certain things in the products for the issues that have been reported. This will also help the customers to decide whether to buy a product or not.
•	Generate visualizations to show which are the best and worst features in a category. This would help vendors to understand the market sentiments and product demand.
•	Help customer to make an informed decision after looking at the analysis on topics, sentiments of other people, and product performance over years. 
•	Provide analytics to E-commerce businesses to take an action on vendors who have heavily skewed negative sentiment. This will lead to better customer satisfaction.__

__Code:__
_NLP Tasks and Machine Learning models would be implemented using Python notebooks and the same would be utilized in the WebApp after converting into Pickle files. This section would be updated with specific file names and architecture information in next phases_.
